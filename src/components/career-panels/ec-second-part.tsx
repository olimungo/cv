                            The second part of my career at the Commission has

                            During my time at DG COMP, I worked as an IT Project
                            Manager, primarily focused on maintaining existing
                            IT systems. Due to the nature of this work,
                            confidentiality was of utmost importance, and I am
                            proud to say that I strictly adhered to the
                            professional code of conduct and ethics.
